			<p class="summary">Cats are crepuscular mammals. They have sharp retractable claws, razor sharp night vision, and an instinctual grace that makes them great hunters. Cats come in an array of breeds, colors, and personalities — from the talkative Siamese to the luxurious Maine Coon.
			   Their body language says a lot: a slowly blinking cat is showing trust, while a flicking tail can signal agitation. And when a cat curls up and purrs on your lap? That’s the universal language of feline approval, sometimes!
